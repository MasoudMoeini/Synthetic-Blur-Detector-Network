# Synthetic Blur Detector Network
Synthetic blur detector network (SBDN) includes two subnetworks: Classifier (discriminative) network and Identifier network. Following jupyter notebook files show the progress of developing Classifier network and Identifier network and final results based on tensorflow-keras library.

The classifier network implementation inspired from [here]:(https://machinelearningknowledge.ai/keras-implementation-of-resnet-50-architecture-from-scratch/)
